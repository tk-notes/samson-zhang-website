An apology through email holds up as an admission of guilt in a court of law.

As soon as you apologize, it's over.

I spent the whole time fighting. I didn't apologize because I believed in what I was fighting for, believed I was in the right. Every statement was carefully considered.

"Sorry," I texted tonight.

Now judgement lay in the hands of history, the hands of time.
