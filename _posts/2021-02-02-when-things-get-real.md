"Let's run up and demo," Saurav said to me. "We've worked hard today, and I want some instant gratification."

After getting up and running this morning -- a couple of steep hill repeats that brought back the heart-pumping gruel of team training -- I set to work on EloLeague. I intended to spend only the morning working on it, but at 1 PM Saurav joined in, and we committed to launching the app today.

We had made the same claim several times earlier and failed to achieve it, but this time the end felt like it was in sight. We had replicated all the functionality of the old tracker. Technically, we already had a fully functioning MVP.

In the afternoon, we worked out a pricing model: a free tier with only one league as previously discussed; an "individual" tier with unlimited leagues but no extra features; and a "club" tier with unlimited leagues and all extra features, like tournaments and player profiles.

Having the model in mind got Saurav super excited, and he kept urging me to get excited too. I stayed pretty cynical until one moment late in the afternoon, when we were talking about whether or not to include player profiles in the MVP. I thought that it wasn't within the core valuing offering and we could do without it, but Saurav had a different take.

"I think it's necessary," he said. "We need it to convince people to pay."

When he said that, things finally clicked for me. I imagined these player profiles locked behind a paywall, and the excitement of making money poured in. This problem that seemed so mystical to me (of making money), that I've been trained by TKS and tech culture to believe is super important to know how to deeply understand and answer, seemed to suddenly have a solution opening right up in front of me, for me to reach out and grab.

I spent the afternoon working on a Stripe integration. Earlier, I had mainly driven the development, re-writing any code Saurav pushed. I thought it was because I was just a better engineer with higher standards, even though I was less experienced. Brennan reminded me, though, that Saurav was learning Next.js for the first time while working. As I slogged through Stripe, I slowed to the same pace as Saurav, and he began to make real, parallel progress on his own dev problems rather than us going in circles around each other. We improved on each other's code, and found a haphazard, bottlenecked synergistic equilibrium in the last few hours that we worked.

We broke at around 7:30. I went to cook, Saurav went to socialize. At 9, Ben came and we found our own vibe together as I made chili oil and he boiled some king oyster mushrooms to make a really cool liangpi-like dish. Then it was 9:30, and a community meeting started that lasted until 10:30. Saurav and I headed back down to the basement. I made a few small changes. "Let's finish by 11:45, to leave time to deploy before midnight," Saurav said at 11:27. I didn't have too much faith that we could do it. Indeed, only at midnight did I get a workable graph and head to head table implemented on the player profile, which I pushed and Saurav managed to make a really nice visual clean-up of by aggregating data points.

It was then that Saurav asked to demo to the guys upstairs. I thought we should wait for a more polished state to soft launch, but Saurav said we could take it casually, build hype now and launch the next night. We went up, both of our laptops in hand.

Catching the end of a long meeting about organizing future Edyfi houses, Saurav hooked up his laptop, and the dashboard popped onto the screen.

He clicked into "Test", and the games and standings of the current league came into view through the pretty new tables I had built. The room reacted generally positively, the atmosphere chill. There was banter about the $30/month cost we had mentioned, to which Saurav replied glowingly, saying that the hecklers would be happy to pay $30/month once they saw what we had to offer.

He clicked into a player profile. A graph and head to head scores loaded into view, and Saurav's prediction proved right: the tone of the room shifted completely, a tangible wave of real intrigue washing over it. The new intrigue was a mix of finding personal value -- a whole new world of comparisons and data visualizations for Edyfi house members to explore -- and the realization that there was much further we could go.

"I would pay for that," Ben said of the graphs.

Saurav kept up the energy and kept going through different parts of the app. There was banter about Next.js and Tailwind, about the broken parts of our app. We pushed back that we weren't ready to launch yet, that no, we were not asking $30/month for the current broken state of things, but it felt like our launch-tomorrow plan had gone out the window: EloLeague had become something real.

"Can I invest in you?" Daniel asked.

"Sign up for a subscription!" Saurav replied.

"No, like angel invest. I'm serious," Daniel said. "I'll help you incorporate for 5% equity. I want to be a part of this."

At the same time, Ben tried to talk us down. "There's a lot more work to be done," he emphasized. He and others talked of an Edyfi syndicate, of seriously throwing a few thousand dollars around; Ben asserted that he wanted to know his share of the earnings before starting on sales work.

The thing I had grinded hard to build over the last few days had taken me into a storm I had always wanted to enter, but not like this: I didn't know how to navigate it like this. I felt totally out of my element. I didn't know what the expectations were. Everything was new and unfamiliar and the fear of failure and ostracization loomed large, while Daniel, Ben, Saurav, and others seemed unaffected.

I found my escape in structure. We should sign a proper co-founder's agreement, I offered. And we'll get some sales before thinking about investment or incorporation or anything else. In my head, I went on the defensive seeing *my vision* and what *I built* being thrown around and diced up so freely. I had done the product and dev work so far. In a co-founder agreement, I want to be CEO.[^ceo]

Later, the conversation returned to earth one step more, as it was just Saurav, Ben, and I around the pool table. "First, we should figure out what each of us want to get out of this," Ben said.

"Don't worry about money," my mom often advises me. "I know you'll make more than me." It seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding of why I want to make money. It's to learn how to make money, not just to have money, and that makes the difference between who's in power and who's not in a capitalistic society. The thought doesn't escape me, though, that there are much larger and more meaningful pursuits. I don't want to spend my vitality working on an app that tracks ping pong and pool games. I was hesitant about even continuously maintaing EloLeague after launch in conversation with Saurav earlier today.

Yet it's a cool opportunity. It's something bigger than what I feel comfortable working with, which means it's both a growth opportunity and terrifying for me, one of which is perhaps a natural attribute of the other.

A similar opportunity came when talking about organizing future houses. The remnants of the community meeting had become a browsing session through potential AirBnB rentals and Edyfi applicants. Brennan and Mattea signed on to host a house in Vermont in the summer. When Saurav came up, he mentioned that he had already been in talks with Ben about building a house in the summer. Oh a whim, I said that I would be down to plan with him too.

When the conversation again reached into rents of thousands of dollars and the commitment of recruiting a dozen *new* members at an even higher bar, knowing how draining just being a participant of this house of Edyfi has been, my instinctual enthusiasm began to peel away. I would meet a lot of interesting people for sure. At best, I would be able to lead and learn from the most powerful group of people I'd have the chance to connect with at the moment. But the opportunity cost of individual growth is high.

I just realized that yesterday was February 1st, the deadline for UMichigan applications, which I at one point planed to fill out. That time has come and gone.

This is a whole new world, a whole new realm of potential, a whole new landscape to take in. I managed to get myself to a critical group and passage, supported by and even leading incredible peers, in just seven months. That's wild to me.

I think I have what it takes to succeed here. I think I have something special, or at least rare, and I happen to have an immense amount of ability, time, connections, and other resources tangible and not at my disposal.

This is a more vulnerable post. I didn't plan to post it in public when I started writing it, or at most in my daily updates. But the personal, vulnerable posts are the most interesting to read, and for me to eventually look back on. I'll likely think myself a fool, but that's the point.

I'm excited to move forwards. I'm excited to make a fool out of the 18 year old kid with a slightly inflated ego writing this blog post right now. Here's to EloLeague, to serendipity, to luck is where opportunity meets preparation, to action builds confidence and precedes motivation, to the success of a startup is predicated on the founder's ability to execute, to the best problem a founder can take on is one they encounter personally, to write as if you were dying.

[^ceo]: My unique advantage is that I'm hugely, hugely product-oriented. I can understand user needs incredibly quickly and well, and am the most competent in both UI/UX and engineering. My biggest weakness is instinctively grasping sales and hype-building opportunities. Would this make me the best CEO out of a team with two others who have worked far more with actual startups and money? Deep down I think I believe that it does. I believe that the chief executive leadership of a company needs to be driven not by sales and expansion, but *product vision* and the desire to build something truly good. Other forces should support the key underlying vision. That's what ultimately distinguishes great startups and companies from lesser ones, a deeply rooted sense of authenticity, no matter how many layers of sales and business are wrapped around it.
