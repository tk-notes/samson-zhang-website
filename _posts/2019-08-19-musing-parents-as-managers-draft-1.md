In an impromptu reflection I wrote tonight in my planner/notebook, I had the following thought: “living w/ family is so, so, so much harder than living alone.”

This came after talking for hours with my mom about my personal app. It made me want to curl up and cry. I curled up on my bed and wondered why. It seemed pathetic, but it didn’t feel like the cringey, attention-seeking wallowing that I knew. It was why I wrote my reflection, and I quickly came to my realization. I felt powerless. My mom was well-intentioned, and honestly her advice was valuable, pushing me past a previous standstill. But my time and energy had been taken from my hands. The project I had intended to work on that night, or once I shifted over to college apps the way I wanted to work on them or even the thoughts I wanted to think were constantly being twisted around out of my control. I feel a sense of dread and frustration whenever my mom says something to me, even as simple as “good night”. As well-intentioned as it is and as much as I love my mom, when we’re in the same house her words towards me feel so controlling and counterproductive.

It made me realize what was happening. My mom was micromanaging. With the best of intentions, even excellent insight and vision, she was being a terrible leader and manager by squashing my initiative and ability to be productive. Essentially as a parent, she’s the project manager, I’m the most hands-on worker, and the project is my future. She deals with higher level stuff I can’t — talking with the execs, the teachers, making sure things don’t get in the way that I can’t handle. She provides guidance and keeps me on track, teaching me skills, guiding me to resources, setting goals to tell me how to spend my time. And at first, as I’m learning everything anew and building up my skills from scratch, it’s okay for her to be involved with every step whenever she can. But the actual project work is very much more in my hands than hers now. My grades come from my learning, studying, doing homework, and writing essays. My projects come from my ideas, my ability and willingness to reach out to others. My college application is made up of all the work I’d done on my own, and the essay.

Imagine your boss messing with your schedule as my mother had mine. Of course it’s an imperfect comparison as I’m her son in her house and she’s much more invested in me than a boss in their employee. But at this point in my life I think a lot of the comparison holds up, as previously mentioned. Most of the time she lets me do my own thing, asking for me to report to her regularly or when she was concerned or interested. This is how to be an effective manager: you let your employees take high levels of initiative, taking the management strain off of your back and allowing you to maximize the productivity of your team. But with this issue in particular — college apps — my mom micromanages, squashing my ability to be productive as an individual and forcing my level of initiative down to the lowest level: doing as told.

My mom is an awful manager. I’ve long accused her of being awful at parenting, because I felt this deep frustration with how she did things. But this isn’t specific enough to be very true, and not nearly true as whole: she loves me and my sister dearly and shows it, listens to us and allows us to be independent and pursue our own ambitions and interests, gives us time off and is accommodating of our needs, expecting us to be accommodating of hers as well. She’s been lenient where it makes sense and held us accountable when it matters, and raised us into resilient, self-confident, and kind and open-minded kids. What my frustration was really at was just the micro scale, her ability to cause endless frustration, stress, and suffering from seemingly nothing. Maybe once I thought I was just a bad child, but then I observed my sister breaking down into tears every time my mom tried to teach her Chinese, or do math problems, or do absolutely anything at all. Unlike the goal-oriented tear-inducing discipline that my dad enforced, the tears my mom caused seemed to cause more harm than good, stopping all progress and causing my mom to chide us for being unappreciative and unable to get work done. She was a terrible, terrible manager, completely incapable of working closely with us to do things that required individual effort and were difficult for us. It’s what causes dread whenever I know she’ll be around, and guilty elation when I know I’ll have extended time on my own, when I leave for boarding school and know I’ll be able to manage myself better, why I seek to spend time away from my house, at Columbia or the library or wherever.

I made a close friend this year, and one of the first things we talked in-depth about were similarities between our parents. Her parents chased after her all day to keep her grades up, work all day, and study for tests, yet she had terrible time management habits, especially unable to get work done when she was at home. A friend of hers dismissed her problems by telling her that living with her family was so much easier than living in a dorm, an experience she shared with me. I talked with her about how it wasn’t, and how in my experience it was the exact opposite: even with a roommate with whom I had sleep schedule and communication problems, I never faced nearly the amount of stress and energy drain alone at Andover as I did from being with my mom all day.

In the back of my mind, I guess I generalized my and my friend’s experiences to living with parents in general. It’s where that reflection line came from: yet another personal experience to confirm it. But my friend’s friend’s remark and my friends who loved spending time with their parents and were able to work really well with them, better than when alone, made me think maybe this generalization wasn’t accurate. Maybe it was something specifically that my mom was doing wrong — and that’s when I connected the dots about management, finding the specific reason why my mom’s parenting methods were so aggressively negative in my mind.

Flipping this around, it’s a thought about how to do parenting right. I read a parenting book about teenagers my mom bought that was just laying on a shelf once, and it was utterly fascinating, about how the process of parenting a teenager was essentially the process of slowly letting go of them. Since then parenting has been something that I’ve been passively super interested in and drawn to, wondering how Atticus Finch seemed to be a perfect parent that, even when having a racist and morally reprehensive stance (Go Set a Watchman) can be a seemingly flawless and respectable parent, expressing it only in a way that’s best for his child, maintaining a perfect balance of instilling his own beliefs in Scout and letting her explore and come to her own conclusions.

And I’m fascinated by how parenting effects how children think of themselves, how they tackle problems and interact with people and the world. This is what’s been most obvious from observing my friends as well as reading about people, and I’ve thought a lot about my own parents and how their raising me and values translate into my behavior. Management has been something I’ve read a bit about and really gotten interested in this summer, and I’ve found so many applications for it in every aspect of everyday life when dealing with people.

To be sure, I’m not really knowledgeable on either subject, from books or from experience. Even as a kid, I’ve only been the kid of two parents, one of them only present really for the first ten years of my life, and the other having spent an equal amount of time 200 miles away from them at boarding school as actually with them the past two years. But it seems now that the experience I’m having isn’t the only way that kids are parented, and not nearly the best. If I become a parent, if/when my child is able to self-manage and take initiative, I will be the best parent I can by being a good manager and letting them do so, actively trying not to micromanage.

// that’s the end of the musing. It’s not super well-written, it’s not well-researched, just a jumble of thoughts I wanted to get down. Some notes below:

Of course, it’ll be much more nuanced than this, and I have separate thoughts about friends who turned out to be either too polite or too comfortable with and defiant of authority instead of having their own healthy dose of self-doubt and room to grow from parents who raised them “too perfectly”. Since my observations only come from friends who are around my age, I also wonder how the effects of parenting will play out as they get older and live their own lives, away from home for perhaps the first time for them. In fact, how has living alone, away from my mom (and dad even more so) effected my thinking? There are some new ideas that I’ve picked up that I really think might never have come through had I been worrying about my mom and dad the whole time, never been able to see past their values and what they’ve instilled in me to what books, friends, and the rest of the world have to offer. Then again, perhaps it’s being in an environment where others are free from parental influence and more willing to share their own wisdom, and maybe not even about environment but just about age and my peers and I growing older and more mature.
