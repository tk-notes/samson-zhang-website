Sitting in a coach bus — "the nicest I've ever seen," says Christina — my relphil reading on my lap in front of me, wearing sleek purple-blue Nordic gear up top down to ugly sweatpants and boots below, listening to quiet music through my headphones, the world races by the window. We're on a highway, so most of the time it's just woods and the occasional small house. But we cross a bridge over the Merrimack River and the world opens up a bit: a sliver of the world, just big enough to hint at its largeness, its complexity. It's a sight I've seen a few times on cross country bus rides and cycling rallywagon ones. It's a feeling I felt regularly growing up, each weekend traveling dozens of miles on a highway to go skiing or to piano lessons or Chinese School or a gathering with family friends. We pass through little hill towns: libraries, churches, office buildings peak up above the trees, the slightly elevated highway giving a sense at once of its enclosing smallness but completeness. There's a whole world outside the window that we pass by each week, yet that I know nothing about, and probably never will. At the same time, there's a whole world inside the window. On the bus, my friends, my work, my team, my sport. In the car, my family. Each a unique atmosphere, uniquely deep relationships that make up my self, unique vibes and experiences.
