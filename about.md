# About Me

{% include home-links.html %}

Hi, my name is Samson Zhang. I love building things and telling stories.

<b>"Do to learn, not learn to do"</b> â€” I love learning and constantly making things and improving. Filmmaking, photography, web dev, and design, I learned from diving into projects, with each one experimenting with something new and hitting a new standard of quality (with the help of the internet and plenty of books). I'm always trying to find new ways to push myself to learn more and make better things.

I care about being impactful and making things better. It's why I want to study the things I do.

- Engineering, to work on designs and technologies that solve real problems and make a lasting contribution to the world.
- UX design, to study and optimize how people interact with technology and with the world.
- Management, to take individual people with their own talents, ambition, and goals, and effectively lead and have everyone work together to do bigger and better things. 
- Journalism, filmmaking, photography, and other forms of storytelling, because stories are the most effective way we communicate with and impact people.

I live in New York City, and I'm currently on a gap year before attending Georgia Tech.
