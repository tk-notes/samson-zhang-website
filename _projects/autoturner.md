# Design & Prototyping Process

<div class='twocol'>
    <div>
        <h2>Week 1: Ideation</h2>
        <p>Coming up with the ideas and basic design for our project.</p>
    </div>
    <div>

    <div>
        <h2>Week 2/3: Early Prototyping</h2>
        <p>We design our mount and grabber mechanism. We spend a lot of time and iterations figuring out the tolerances of the printer and changing our dimensions slightly to make the mechanism work.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        {% include image-slider.html data="grabber-3.jpg,proto-2-draw-1.png,proto-1-draw-2.png,proto-1-cad-2.png" %}

        <h2>Week 4: Grabber Testing, Mount Early Prototyping</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Week 5: First Functional Prototype, Testing</h2>
        <p>After several iterations, the whole device put together finally works as we want it to. We start designing an acrylic assembly to make the whole device sturdier and more reliable.</p>

        <h2>Week 6: Final Prototype (for now)</h2>
        <p>We laser cut and assemble our acrylic base; the device is now one piece, without relying on pieces of cardboard taped to the stand to function. It can now be moved around and sit on a grand piano. We also build a foot pedal. The device is as you saw in the first video (again here):</p>
