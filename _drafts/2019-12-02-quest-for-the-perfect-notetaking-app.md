I’m obsessed with notetaking and writing apps. I’m on a neverending quest to find the perfect one, with the correct balance of minimalism and functionality in writing experience and organization, that allows me to work collaboratively online but also offline, that is accessible via web and mobile, and that looks pretty so I can actually enjoy using it.

These demands are pretty vague and subjective. I don't even know fully what I want, and what makes a good writing app varies from use case to use case. But in my journey writing documents and notes for school, for clients, for personal projects, and when running a newspaper, I've used a good amount of different writing apps. In this post I’ll share some of the products and features I’ve appreciated most.

# Document Editors
## Google Docs
For me, Google Docs is a reliable default as a writing app.

No other app can match its seamless cloud features but also offline function. On any computer or phone with an internet connection, your docs are just a Google sign-in away. Without internet, it takes just a little bit of configuration to get Docs working as a full-functioning offline word processor.

When online, Google Docs is the standard platform for collaborative writing and note-taking. Everyone has a Google Account, so it takes zero extra setup or commitment to jump into a doc, as easy and ubiquitous as writing on a whiteboard in an in-person meeting.

Lastly, it’s just a solid text processor. 95% of the time it has all the document editing features you need, be it formatting, commenting, revision history, or whatever else, but it’s more stripped down than something like Microsoft Word, feeling lightweight and responsive.

Google Docs doesn't offer many bells and whistles beyond being a collaborative document editor. Documents are organized through Google Drive, which uses a traditional file-and-folder structure, without any features specifically designed for notetaking, such as organization by notebook. On the other hand, it doesn't offer more specialized features like draft versioning or Markdown support.


## Dropbox Paper

Outside of Google Docs, [Dropbox Paper](https://paper.dropbox.com/) is my most-used writing app. I’m writing this entry in Paper right now, and I keep a running journal using it.

In many ways, Paper is very similar to Google Docs. Instead of Google Drive, Paper documents are stored in Dropbox and accessible online and through mobile apps. Paper supports real-time collaboration with a  Dropbox account, just like Google Docs. However, Paper doesn’t work offline. Even if a document is loaded, if the device is disconnected from internet, an error message will appear and the editor will be disabled.

When online, however, Paper shines in that it's content-focused and much more streamlined to use compared to Docs. Paper entirely sidelines document-formatting features. There are no pages, just a continuously scrolling doc with a white background. You can’t change the font, font size, or line spacing. All the formatting options that matter for content are still here. You can bold, italicize, and underline text, and create different levels of headings. Features like tables and images stay out of your way with simple formatting options, and more specialized features like Markdown editing and exporting, inline LaTeX, and codeblocks are really nice additions.


# Notetaking Apps
## Simplenote

![Screenshot of Simplenote]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/blog/2019-12/simplenote.png)

[Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/) is as stripped-down as it gets, reminiscent of Apple's Notes app. When I first used it, it had no support for any formatting whatsoever, just plaintext in a default sans-serif font (now it supports Markdown formatting). A sidebar contains all of your notes, which can also be tagged for filtering. Simplenote offers web, desktop, and mobile apps, and cloud sync through a registered account.

I used Simplenote heavily for a while. Everything from a quick project idea or address, to class notes, to full emails, documents, and scripts I wrote in Simplenote. It worked well enough, and zero formatting and organization made it super fast to work with.

However, going back now I find it to be cluttered. All my old notes and tags are just there, with no way to archive them without deleting them permanently. When I tried to reorganize the labels, I had issues with labels duplicating and un-assigning themselves. The writing experience is simple and enjoyable, but it's a shame organization features are minimal and unreliable.


## Evernote

![Screenshot of Evernote]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/blog/2019-12/evernote.png)

[Evernote](https://evernote.com/) has long been the standard notetaking app. Its feature set and cloud/offline functionality are compelling, but the writing experience and bloat were turn-offs for me. On both web and desktop interfaces, the editor spans the width of the window minus the sidebar, and granular font formatting controls are a nuisance more than they are useful. I tried it a few years ago for a project or two and again when writing this post, but I never found a reason to use it over another app on this list.


## OneNote
Two years ago, I got a Surface Laptop. With it, I got a Surface Pen, and for a semester I took exclusively digitally handwritten notes using [Microsoft OneNote](https://products.office.com/en-us/onenote/digital-note-taking-app).

OneNote’s support for the Surface Pen is top notch, and its options for paper and pen types strike just the right balance of useful and minimal for me. I haven’t used that many apps for handwritten notetaking, but I haven’t found any reason to switch from OneNote.

I also really like OneNote’s organization structure with sections and notebooks. It’s easy for me to jump in and start writing, but all my old notes stay neatly contained and easy to find. OneNote offers web and mobile apps as well, and syncs through Microsoft account while being primarily and fully functional offline.

The typing experience, however, is not great. If you start a note and just start typing, a text box appears and expands down the page as you write. Within the text box formatting happens via a Word-like ribbon with granular controls. OneNote is definitely usable for typed notes, but also definitely not ideal for it.


# Other
## Google Keep

![Screenshot of Google Keep]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/blog/2019-12/gkeep.png)

[Keep is Google’s solution for short notes](https://keep.google.com/). It has an interface of little cards, reminiscent of Post-It notes on a board. It’s built into Android really well, so I find myself using it often to save web links similar to how you would with Evernote or OneNotes' web clippers. It's easy to quickly make a new note and jot things down to refer back to either. The card layout makes it easy to see notes at a glance, but hard to keep organized, though non-destructive archiving is a feature I appreciate a lot.


## Dynalist/Workflowy

![Screenshot of Dynalist]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/blog/2019-12/dynalist.png)

The idea behind [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/) is that your entire account is one big list. If you click into a subitem, it becomes the top level and all of its subitems fill the screen.

[Dynalist is a similar list-centric notetaking app](https://dynalist.io/), but it lets you split lists between documents. Bullet point lists are great for things like class notes and project outlines. Even in full text processors I find I often end up just creating lists. In these cases Dynalist makes it easy to move around items, add colored labels, and keep things organized and efficient.

(By default Dynalist has a pretty clunky interface, but I wrote a Stylish skin to make it prettier and more usable -- get it here!)


## Caret/Typora

![Screenshot of Caret]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/blog/2019-12/caret.png)

[Caret](https://caret.io/) and [Typora](https://typora.io/) are single-view Markdown editors that I found when I was working a lot with Markdown while building my website. On its homepage, Caret says its selling points are “its clean interface, productivity features and obsessive attention to detail.” Caret is by far the most gorgeous writing app I’ve used. It’s just an offline editor, offering no cloud or organization features of its own, so it’s not something I could ever use as a go-to writing app, but I wanted to include it on my list to show just how pretty writing apps can be.


## Trello

Not really a notetaking app, but [Trello](https://trello.com/) is an app I’ve recently started using to keep track of tasks and projects. Organizing projects with shared Google Docs and group chats is often super painful. Trello makes keeping track of things much easier with cards that can be labeled, commented on, and moved between lists, making notes understandable at a glance and a breeze to organize and update.


## Draft

![Screenshot of Draft]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/blog/2019-12/draft.png)

Draft is another writing app I found while looking for Markdown editors online. Draft's special features are draft versioning and change tracking. Its main use case pitch is with collaborative writing, allowing an author to review feedback and changes from contributors. Its interface reminds me of GitHub's change tracking, dearly beloved by programmers (me included). Unlike Caret, Draft is a web app with its own folder system and cloud sync features, including integration with Google Drive, Dropbox, and Evernote.

The interface is super clean and minimal, and through the settings the font, font size, and background and text color can be changed universally. While the editor supports Markdown formatting, it's not rendered inline, instead requiring a dedicated un-editable Preview view to see formatting.

I've only tested Draft on one document so far, and that's this blog post. I love writing in Markdown and in such a streamlined interface, but not being able to see formatting inline is a bummer, and I’m not too keen on storing all my documents on such a boxed-in platform by an indie developer. Draft versioning is a cool feature, as I would otherwise duplicate my document to have a copy of the original draft, but it's not important enough to me to justify a $40/year subscription over Dropbox Paper or Google Docs.


## Pencil, Pen, and Muji Notebooks
I have two physical notebooks that I always take with me: a B5 Muji notebook and a Moleskin planner. A physical planner is a lot more discreet, unambiguous, and reliable than a phone or laptop app, so I use it to keep track of little things that come up day-to-day. For similar reasons larger notebooks are useful. I could draw diagrams through OneNote on my Surface, but often it’s much easier to use good old paper notebooks. I have a B5 Muji notebook for each of my classes and a separate one for my personal use: jotting things down as I read a book, drawing wireframes and diagrams for projects, planning out a schedule for the day.


# How I Use Writing Apps
So all this said, how do I use all these different apps?

At one end of the scale is Google Docs. For any document where formatting or shareability matters, such as schoolwork or shared agendas or statements, Google Docs is the obvious choice. Anything requiring more formatting than Google Docs can provide would find its way to a non-text-editor like Illustrator or InDesign.

For my personal somewhat longform notes, it’s a tossup between Google Docs and Dropbox Paper. I enjoy Paper’s writing experience better, and when I can I use it consistently, such as for journaling. However, oftentimes Google Docs ends up being more convenient. When I’m offline or even just have a flaky connection, Paper isn’t a viable option. If I’m already working in Google Drive, say if I have images that I want to insert stored there, it’s much easier to just jump into a new Google Doc.

Quick notes end up being scattered the most. My Google Keep is a pile of little things that I care about and want to get back to, with links and quotes and lists put together. Dynalist is the same way, with several running lists of project ideas and things I want to get done that I often add to without maintaining well. Now that I’m starting to use Trello, some tasks that might have ended up on Dynalist or Keep end up there too.

All of these apps are incredibly well-built and powerful. Google Docs and Paper come pretty close to being perfect for me. More than waiting to find an app that does everything perfectly for me, I would gain the most from giving my existing tools a good cleanup and keeping them well-organized. That being said, I’ll still continue to look for cool products and possible use cases. If you know of any, be sure to send them my way!
